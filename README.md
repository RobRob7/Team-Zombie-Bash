# ZOMBIE BASH
Zombie Bash is a thrilling rhythm game where you drive a truck down a zombie-infested highway, steering to hit zombies that spawn in sync with the beats of a song. The goal is to survive the musical chaos and avoid missing too many zombies to reach the end of the track with a high score!
